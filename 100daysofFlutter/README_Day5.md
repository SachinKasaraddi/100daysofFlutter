Trying to achieve this design

Learnings

* Dart programming from [](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej_Pcr4uC2Q)

* Card widget
* Found Chip Widget but wasn't useful, since its big and I was looking for badge hence had to write custom one.
* First logic introduced to check whether puppy is Male or Female.
* Curved corner radius used for cards.
